# Genesis: Forward into the Future
Welcome to the Genesis Project! In our modern day, the technologies grow blazingly fast and deliver more powerful and robust changes in our lives that make significant difference in our wellbeing, standards of living and the way how we make the everlasting memories. We as developers stand in the frontline of those innovations and crowdfund the open-source solutions with ideas and implementations.  

One of the most powerful movements in the current IT is **artificial intelligence**. The AI systems are able to process large quantity of data and produce high-quality expertise that then can be used to make suggestions, predict changes, automate not-so-straightword tasks and more. Today AI is used in medical and scientific research, crime fighting, self-driving cars, inoformational space personalisation and various kinds of detections in big data and many other. Artificial intelligence is capable of moving our civilisation in the bright prominent world where our lives will be revolutionarised.  

However, is modern AI really that *smart?* The sci-fi novels of the 80s were forseeing in the 21st century AI will rebel against the humanity, but in reality we find it hard to create a trival system that's capable of distinguishing cats from dogs. The reason for that is that computers are built in such way that on the underlying level, they follow the strict steps programmer instructs it. As a matter of fact, it's improbable to write an algorithm that can tell exactly if a picture deceips a cat or a dog because of their large verities, and in order to solve a number of these *flexible* problems, **machine learning** was born.  

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of computer science that deals with solving problems through learning from given material and accamulating experience that it can use later. From our example, a machine can distinguish cats from dogs by consuming incredibly large amount of labelled pictures (dataset) and analysing them through a series of complex mathematician algorithms that produces a model of cats and dogs, and by seeing a lot of them, machine will be able to tell them apart accurely enough the next time. And on the top of that, modern developers do not need to implement those cycles of training themselves but use available frameworks that already take care of it, such as TensorFlow or Scicit-learn.  

But is ML really that strong? It is certainly able to pull impressive feats with popular products like **GitHub Copilot** or **GPL-3**. On the other hand, what made those neural networks successful was that it was trained on ridiciously large and quaity data with billions of parameters, which makes it inaccessible for the majority of programmers. Furthermore, ML is extremely narrow, which makes it only great at some one particular task it was desgined for, and it cannot do anything else and even cross-use its experience between multiple domains. This makes machine learning obviously strong but fundamentally flawed in its methodology and implementation.
